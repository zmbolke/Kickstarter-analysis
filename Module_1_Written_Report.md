Kickstarting with Excel

Overview of Project: Louise raises funds for theatrical events such as plays and musicals. Her most recent project came close to its fundraising goal shortly after she began the campaign. She is now curious how different campaigns progress relative to their launch dates and fundraising goals. 

Purpose: The purpose of this project is to identify the the best time of year and optimal fundraising goal for a theater campaign. The dataset being used will be the Kickstarter dataset provided and can be found here: https://github.com/zmbolke/Kickstarter-analysis/blob/main/Kickstarter_Challenge.xlsx

The graphs described herein are found on the first two tabs of the aforementioned spreadsheet.   

Analysis and Challenges: The analysis performed herein is based on the provided data and was initially reviewed to get feel for the dataset. Outcomes were colorcoded to more quickly identify "Successful", "Failed", and "Canceled" campaigns. New columns were added to the spreadsheet to separate parent and sub categories and Unix timestamps were converted to an easier to view month, day, and year format. Some of the challenges faced in this analysis were to learning to use excel tools such as pivot tables and complete functions like COUNTIFS. After learning the proper uses for these tools the organization and visualization of the data was relatively simple. Two primary charts were made to represent the pertinent information for our analysis, as shown below. The charts were then reviewed for reasonableness.   

Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date: The first chart is a marked line graph based on a pivot table. The pivot table is filtered to include all years from 2009 through 2017 and only theater campaigns in the parent category. The graph displays the count of successful, failed, and canceled campaigns based on start dates grouped by the month of the year. Based on the analyzed dataset, it appears that May and June are the two most successful months for theater campaign start dates. 

Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals: The second chart is a line graph that displays the percent of successful, failed, and canceled plays grouped by fundraising goals. There are twelve total groups ranging from less than $1,000 to greater than $50,000 primarily in $5,000 increments. This was accomplished by using the COUNTIFS function in excel and the specified dollar ranges, outcomes, and filtered to only include plays. We can see that there were no canceled plays from 2009 to 2017. The most successful fundraising range was less than $1,000 at a 76% success rate followed closely by $1,000 to $4,999 at 73%. The least successful fundraising range was from $45,000 to $49,999 at a 100% failure rate.

Challenges and Difficulties Encountered: As previously stated the organization and visualization of the dataset was not particularly complex. The dataset however does have limitations based on the years used. The dataset ranges from 2009 to 2017. This is a relatively wide range of data when looking for the correct fundraising goal. I believe that data from the previous three years would likely be a more accurate representation of successful fundraising goals moving forward. Additionally, The analysis performed did not cover the topics of the plays. Plays often have some cultural relevance or political commentary. If the topic of the play is unpopular or irrelevant to the timeframe, then the success or failure of the campaign could have nothing to do with start date or fundraising goal, which would make the analysis irrelevant.   

Results: Two concussions that can be drawn based on this analysis are that the best month to start a fundraising campaign for plays appears to be May and the most successful fundraising amount is less than $5,000. We can identify that while looking at fundraising goal success rates for plays and the number of successful theater campaigns based on start date do not guarantee a successful play, these topics are relevant areas to analyze. We also recognize that additional factors such as topic of the play and current sentiment toward the topic can also play a role in its funding. An additional graph that could help identify success rate would be the duration of the campaign. Campaigns that reached their fundraising goal in a shorter period of time could help us identify more relevant topics.
