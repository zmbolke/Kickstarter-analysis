Based on the data provided, we find that the most successful theater camparigns begin during the months of April thourgh Ausgust, as shown in the graph on the "Outcome Based on Launch Date" tab.
Looking more specifically at theater plays in the US, we find that the median goal for successful plays is $3,000 with the upper quartile at $5,000.  
Looking at musicals in Great Britain, we find that the median goal is 2,000 pounds and the upper quartile pledged amount is roughly 1,500 pounds.
Based on the information presented above and the data found in the kickstarter analysis spreadsheet, we recommend that a campaign for a play in the US should begin in the months from April to August with a conservative goal of $3,000. For a musical in Great Britain, we recommend similar timing with a goal of 1,500 pounds.
